## Description
Welcome to the wizardry employee management system. This is the state of the art new muggle technology, creating the very first Auror Intelligence (AI) called EM. EM will help you keep track of all your wizards and witches, including their roles and departments. You can even add new roles and departments as the wizarding world constantly expands on new discoveries and assign new employees to those very new roles.
